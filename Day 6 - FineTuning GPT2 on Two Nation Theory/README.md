## 📜 GPT-2 Fine-Tuned on Two-Nation Theory Conversational Dataset

### 🧠 Project Overview

This repository documents the fine-tuning of **OpenAI’s GPT-2 model** on a specially crafted conversational dataset focused on the **Two-Nation Theory**—a central concept in the ideological foundation of Pakistan.

The dataset simulates realistic Q\&A interactions between a user (`Yasir`) and an AI assistant, designed to educate or inform users about pre-independence historical events, philosophies, and political movements surrounding the partition of the Indian subcontinent.

---

### 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:

* Fine-tune a language model to **understand and respond to historical queries** related to the Two-Nation Theory.
* Preserve and propagate **historical knowledge** in a structured, conversational format.
* Explore the application of **Generative AI** in educational and historical contexts.

---

### 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of **500+ conversational entries**, each representing a single-turn Q\&A between a user and an AI assistant. It covers topics such as:

* The ideological roots of the Two-Nation Theory
* Key events from 1857 to 1947
* Prominent leaders and thinkers like **Allama Iqbal**, **Sir Syed Ahmad Khan**, and **Muhammad Ali Jinnah**
* Political movements including the **Khilafat Movement**, **Aligarh Movement**, and **Lahore Resolution**
* Counter-arguments and responses from figures opposed to partition

Each entry maintains a consistent role-based format to mimic natural dialogue, making the dataset ideal for conversational fine-tuning tasks.

### 📘 Sample Entry

```
Yasir: What was the Two-Nation Theory?
AI: The Two-Nation Theory stated that Muslims and Hindus were two distinct nations with their own customs, religion, and traditions, and therefore Muslims should have a separate homeland.
```

---

### 🌐 Language & Format

* **Language**: English
* **Format**: JSONL (`.jsonl`) — one text field per line containing a full Q\&A
* **Style**: Instructional, informative, and formal tone

---

### 🧠 Applications

This fine-tuned model can be used for:

* Building **AI-powered educational assistants** in history or civics
* Creating **chatbots for cultural awareness and historical literacy**
* Enhancing **museum or archive interfaces** with intelligent Q\&A capabilities
* Supporting **research and debate preparation tools**

---

### 🔍 Why This Matters

The Two-Nation Theory is not only historically significant but also politically and culturally sensitive. AI models trained on mainstream datasets often lack the depth or accuracy to address such nuanced topics.

By crafting a specialized dataset, this project:

* Fills a gap in **historically contextual AI training**
* Demonstrates the power of **domain-specific fine-tuning**
* Provides a resource for educators, researchers, and developers focused on **South Asian studies**
