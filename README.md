# 🧠 30 Days of Generative AI Mastery – Learn, Build, Deploy

Welcome to my **30-Day Generative AI Mastery Journey** — a hands-on, practical roadmap to master modern **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Generative AI models** like GPT-2, T5, BART, and more.

This repo contains **daily notebooks**, code, theory, prompts, and experiments related to:
- 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- 🔥 Large Language Models (LLMs)
- 🧪 Fine-tuning Transformers (GPT-2, FLAN-T5)
- 🎨 Prompt Engineering & AI Apps
- ⚙️ Text Generation, Summarization, Q&A
- 🚀 Gradio & FastAPI GenAI Tool Deployment
