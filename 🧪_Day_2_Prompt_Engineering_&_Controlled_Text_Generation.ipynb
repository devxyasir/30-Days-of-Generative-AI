In my experience as an employee of many companies I've seen people use their knowledge for personal gain or profit rather than learning new things that other employees can't even think up! So if you're going on business trips where there's lots talk over email/social media etc., then it might be better not to spend time talking too much at all when doing so will result into making mistakes which may lead someone else down some road towards failure :) It would also help them avoid being stuck working out how long before getting back home from work because once again we'd end our day by trying to figure stuff OUT instead!! YASIR : How do humans get around these problems without using computers?! If one person does what he wants… well why should anyone need another human just like us?? But really…. Why did everyone stop thinking twice while driving??? And who cares anyway.. We don'T care anymore!!!\n"
